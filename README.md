## Scenario

You spent the last year as an independent back-end developer and worked on several projects of varying sizes and difficulties.

Last week, you received a message on your freelance platform asking for help with a new project. Hot sauces are becoming increasingly popular, largely thanks to the YouTube series «Hot Ones». This is why this new client, the Piiquante chili condiment brand, wants to develop a web application for the review of hot sauces called «Hot Takes».
